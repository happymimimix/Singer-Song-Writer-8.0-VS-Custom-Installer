# Singer-Song-Writer-8.0-VS-Custom-Installer

Since Singer Song Writer 8.0 VS's installer makes a stupid check on whether the OS is 64bit and refuses to install even when 64bit windows today has a very powerful WOW64 that can perfectly interpret their ancient 32bit code! 

So I made this custom installer for SSW8.0VS that does not check for system bits.
